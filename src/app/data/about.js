CURATOR’S VOICE

<br /><br />
Processing Architecture 

<br /><br />
2020 radically changed our perception of space, from avoiding spaces we normally share with others to being repatriated, prevented from seeing colleagues, friends or family. From acting collectively on line, we have become collective on-liners. Meanwhile wars have continued, cities have been flooded, refugees have been refused entrance, and people have starved. Where do all these overwhelming issues leave architects and architecture? What perspectives and actions should be taken? And how do the economic and ecologic crisis affect our cities, culture, and eventually democracy?

<br /><br />
Big questions, big challenges - and lots of work to be done. But also lots of relevant architectural matters to be discussed before initiating. Dialogues with the new architects about their projects should therefore have been filmed and available here on the Online Exhibition Site, but like so many other things filming was cancelled due to COVID 19. That means you can ‘only’ scroll through the projects  and experience how the new architects Process Architecture, eventually download the full thesises, and hopefully be inspired to joint venture with a new employee.

<br /><br />
So how do architects process architecture in times of crisis and how can architecture be part of the solution? Well, fundamentally architects have the ability to embed thought or emotion in space and buildings, they are aware that we are continually shaped by our surroundings, and that architecture can shift corporate cultures, lift spirits and impact the wellbeing of people. That´s why architects, urban landscapers or city planners are part of the solution. 

<br /><br />
This year’s projects reveal a sincere interest in contributing to a better world, were social relations rather than objectified architecture matter. The new architects are occupied with nature and the creation of cultural landscapes, but at the same time they master digital tooling. They have empathy and a willingness to make a change. 

<br /><br />
The New Architects are ready to Process Architecture.
