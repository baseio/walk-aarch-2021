Processing Architecture 

<br /><br />
2020 radically changed our perception of space. From avoiding spaces we normally share with others to being repatriated, prevented from seeing colleagues, friends or family. From acting collectively on line, to becoming collective on-liners. Meanwhile wars have continued, cities have been flooded, refugees have been refused entrance, and people have starved. Where do all these overwhelming issues leave architects and architecture? What perspectives and actions should be taken? And how do the economic and ecologic crisis affect our cities, culture, and eventually democracy?

<br /><br />
Big questions, big challenges - and lots of work to be done. But also lots of relevant architectural matters to be discussed before initiating. Dialogues with the new architects about their projects should therefore have been filmed and available here on the Online Exhibition Site, but like so many other things filming was cancelled due to COVID 19. That means you can ‘only’ scroll through the projects  and experience how the new architects Process Architecture, eventually download their full thesis, and hopefully be inspired to joint venture with a new employee.

<br /><br />
For how do architects process architecture in times of crisis and how can architecture be part of the solution? Well, fundamentally architects have the ability to embed thought or emotion in space and buildings, they are aware that we are continually shaped by our surroundings, and that architecture can shift corporate cultures, lift spirits and impact the wellbeing of people. That´s why architects, urban landscapers or city planners are part of the solution. 

<br /><br />
This year’s projects reveal a sincere interest in contributing to a better world, were social relations rather than objectified architecture matter. The new architects are occupied with making solutions for the vulnerable, they take action  in nature and the creation of new cultural landscapes, but at the same time they master digital tooling and know how to Process Architecture with empathy and a willingness to make a change.

"In Between Typologies – The Future Challenges of Refshaleøen"  

<br /><br />
The project structurally and strategically explores gentrification in multiple scales while offering an alternative to how we might view urban development and influence the current trajectory to be more inventive, playful and site-specific. It is interested in the inherent qualities of place. 

<br /><br />
The research that supports the ideation process successfully pendulums between two scales as it positions the project’s intentions. At once exploring around the subject matter – placing the present conundrum in a global history of city developments – and researching into the subject matter – the specificity of Copenhagen, Refshaleøen, the particular site. 

<br /><br />
The resulting project is at once rigorous and playful in its expression. A piece of infrastructure as well as a social and cultural destination, the building will transform itself with the seasons, with the changing currents of the water, or society. It manages to be simultaneously permanent and temporary, thereby posing important questions into the qualities of temporal and how much – or little – building one can get away with to make a measurable impact in an urban environment. Deeply contextual, one can imagine that if it were to be built, it would be hard to question whether it had not been there from the start.  

<br /><br />
“Do we design governed by certain market forces or to facilitate urban life, or can we build somewhere at the critical intersection?”, the project asks. While taking a stand, it is also a clearly sober proposal as to how architects might use their training and intellect to create exciting opportunities precisely in the tension zone of a seemingly polarized arena. And that’s precisely where the greatest strength of the project lies, in its daring optimism for a future that is surprisingly achievable.

"Holstebro Søpark"

<br /><br />
With the project, ‘Holstebro Søpark’, Simon Kobberub Smedsmo
combines sports facilities and nature experiences at a lake near Holstebro. He demonstrates and documents a convincing understanding of working in a complex contextual setting in the transition between city and nature. 

<br />
The project establishes a center for rowing, a sea-bath, and a sequence of recreative facilities. Together, it creates a significant unity that shields off towards traffic and opens itself towards the lake's quietness and visual beauty. 

<br /><br />
The project radiates an architectural stringency, it is sustainable, and it operates smoothly in all scales it addresses. Simon manages to communicate his ideas, his concepts, and his design in a clear and easily understandable way. It illustrates a high level of craftsmanship and professionalism, which are the primary reasons, he is awarded the VOLA scholarship.
