PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE

<br />
For the first time Aarhus School of Architecture presents its traditional Graduation Show in a 100% digital format. The digital exhibition is a consequence of the lock down caused by COVID19, that with a flap of a butterfly’s wing, all of a sudden united and divided the world in to a new reality of fear, isolation and death, leaving stations, stadiums, schools and streets desolate, dramatically changing our behavior.

<br /><br />
Under normal circumstances an exhibition on architecture consists of the physical encounter with drawings, models and materials, so, how can a digital exhibition replace that experience? The answer is: It cannot. But perhaps it can something else. In any case, every effort has been made to create an exhibition that embraces the spatial and the sensory, going from the usual physical support structures to a digital interface, developed by gamers and programmers.

<br /><br />
The question is, how will the temporarily imposed Social Distancing affect architecture in the future. Is it even possible to go from developing architecture that connects people, to architecture that disables human relations? And, what is the role of architecture in this challenging situation? It is too early to find the answers in the Exhibition, but you will find the answers to other urgent questions among this year´s projects.

<br /><br />
WDAcomprises a space of columns designed specifically for the Exhibition by the new Architects, where the school constitutes the foundation of the space, – but they are the pillars on which the architecture of tomorrow is built.

<br /><br />
WELCOME > THE EXHIBITION IS (ALWAYS) OPEN!
