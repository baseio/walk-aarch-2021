Processing Architecture 

<br /><br />
2020 radically changed our perception of space. From avoiding spaces we normally share with others to being repatriated, prevented from seeing colleagues, friends or family. From acting collectively on line, to becoming collective on-liners. Meanwhile wars have continued, cities have been flooded, refugees have been refused entrance, and people have starved. Where do all these overwhelming issues leave architects and architecture? What perspectives and actions should be taken? And how do the economic and ecologic crisis affect our cities, culture, and eventually democracy?

<br /><br />
Big questions, big challenges - and lots of work to be done. But also lots of relevant architectural matters to be discussed before initiating. Dialogues with the new architects about their projects should therefore have been filmed and available here on the Online Exhibition Site, but like so many other things filming was cancelled due to COVID 19. That means you can ‘only’ scroll through the projects  and experience how the new architects Process Architecture, eventually download their full thesis, and hopefully be inspired to joint venture with a new employee.

<br /><br />
For how do architects process architecture in times of crisis and how can architecture be part of the solution? Well, fundamentally architects have the ability to embed thought or emotion in space and buildings, they are aware that we are continually shaped by our surroundings, and that architecture can shift corporate cultures, lift spirits and impact the wellbeing of people. That´s why architects, urban landscapers or city planners are part of the solution. 

<br /><br />
This year’s projects reveal a sincere interest in contributing to a better world, were social relations rather than objectified architecture matter. The new architects are occupied with making solutions for the vulnerable, they take action  in nature and the creation of new cultural landscapes, but at the same time they master digital tooling and know how to Process Architecture with empathy and a willingness to make a change. 

<br /><br />

<br /><br />
<strong>VOLA PRIZE</strong>

<br /><br />
<a href="#alexander-fagerholt">Alexander Hejgaard Fagerholt</a>
<br /><br />
"In Between Typologies – The Future Challenges of Refshaleøen"  

<br /><br />
The project structurally and strategically explores gentrification in multiple scales while offering an alternative to how we might view urban development and influence the current trajectory to be more inventive, playful and site-specific. It is interested in the inherent qualities of place. 

<br /><br />
The research that supports the ideation process successfully pendulums between two scales as it positions the project’s intentions. At once exploring around the subject matter – placing the present conundrum in a global history of city developments – and researching into the subject matter – the specificity of Copenhagen, Refshaleøen, the particular site. 

<br /><br />
The resulting project is at once rigorous and playful in its expression. A piece of infrastructure as well as a social and cultural destination, the building will transform itself with the seasons, with the changing currents of the water, or society. It manages to be simultaneously permanent and temporary, thereby posing important questions into the qualities of temporal and how much – or little – building one can get away with to make a measurable impact in an urban environment. Deeply contextual, one can imagine that if it were to be built, it would be hard to question whether it had not been there from the start.  

<br /><br />
“Do we design governed by certain market forces or to facilitate urban life, or can we build somewhere at the critical intersection?”, the project asks. While taking a stand, it is also a clearly sober proposal as to how architects might use their training and intellect to create exciting opportunities precisely in the tension zone of a seemingly polarized arena. And that’s precisely where the greatest strength of the project lies, in its daring optimism for a future that is surprisingly achievable.

<strong>VOLA PRIZE</strong>

<br /><br />
<a href="/#simon-smedsmo">Simon Kobberub Smedsmo</a>
<br /><br />
"Holstebro Søpark"

<br /><br />
With the project, ‘Holstebro Søpark’, Simon Kobberub Smedsmo
combines sports facilities and nature experiences at a lake near Holstebro. He demonstrates and documents a convincing understanding of working in a complex contextual setting in the transition between city and nature. 

<br />
The project establishes a center for rowing, a sea-bath, and a sequence of recreative facilities. Together, it creates a significant unity that shields off towards traffic and opens itself towards the lake's quietness and visual beauty. 

<br /><br />
The project radiates an architectural stringency, it is sustainable, and it operates smoothly in all scales it addresses. Simon manages to communicate his ideas, his concepts, and his design in a clear and easily understandable way. It illustrates a high level of craftsmanship and professionalism, which are the primary reasons, he is awarded the VOLA scholarship.

<strong>3XN TRAVEL GRANT</strong>: Architecture Shapes Behaviour

<br /><br />
<a href="#alexander-fagerholt">Alexander Hejgaard Fagerholt</a>
<br /><br />
"In between typologies - The future challenges at Refshaleøen"

<br /><br />
The winning project investigates today's redevelopment of
our cities’ central industrial areas. On the broader scale, it is
an experiment of private ownership and public urban life. It
challenges development controlled by market forces and
suggests a new type of development inspired by urban life.
The project cleverly analyses the way the area has
developed over time and gives the potential for building on
top of this unique and strong industrial character. The area
challenges traditional building typologies by giving the old
industrial buildings a new use.

<br /><br />
The 3XN Travel Grant is awarded to a student who focuses
on the constant changes in the use of our cities, while
illustrating how architects play a vital role in integrating
elements from the local history in the new development. By
suggesting a set of solutions that incorporate existing
conditions, innovation, and knowledge sharing, the project
underlines how architects can design new typologies that
can help support existing urban life.

3XN/GXN have established the ”Architecture Shapes
Behaviour” prize in association with AARCH. The prize will be
awarded to a graduate student of AARCH. By introducing this
prize we wish to draw attention to/focus on how human behaviour
is influenced by the architectural surroundings, independent
of scale. The winner will receive a travel grant of 10.000 DKK.

<strong>CEBRA</strong>–prisen

<br /><br />
<a href="#malene-jors-nielsen">Malene Jørs Nielsen</a>
<br /><br />
"Night Tide – Encountering natural phenomena on Mandø"

<br /><br />
CEBRA-prisen tildeles Malene Jørs Nielsen for det eftertænksomme afgangsprojekt Night Tide – Encountering natural phenomena on Mandø. 

<br /><br />
Projektets fremhæves for en præcis og smuk læsning af Mandø, der oversættes til et følsomt og minimalistisk arkitektonisk udtryk forankret i tidevandsøen Mandøs helt særlige natur. Inspireret af tidevandet, diger, høfder og den allestedsnærværende horisont og himmel, fremstår det som en ’målepind’ for tidevandets rytme over dagen, året og ved stormflod. 

<br /><br />
Projektet tilbyder et næsten poetisk møde mellem iagttageren og naturens fænomener, og de smukke illustrationer, der konsekvent benyttes, skaber velvalgte mindelser om de danske Skagensmalere og den amerikanske kunstner James Turells værker. 

<br /><br />
Et stilfærdigt rumligt forløb iscenesætter bevægelsen og opholdet i det langstrakte rumlige objekt, der bedst kan beskrives som en ’arkitektonisk stjernekikkert’, hvor oplevelsen af nattehimlens uendelighed og tidevandets rytmiske ændring af stedet er i smuk fokus uden andre virkemidler end de menneskelige sanser. 

<br /><br />
Med CEBRA-prisen følger Le Corbusiers samlede værker samt CEBRA_files_01+02+03, og det er vores håb, at Malene Jørs Nielsen med denne opmuntring vil fortsætte sin undersøgende tilgang til mødet mellem naturen, mennesket og det menneskeskabte.
