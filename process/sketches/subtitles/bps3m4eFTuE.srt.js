00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,480
good evening everybody

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,640
as you've seen by now this isn't a

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,720
normal convention

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,080
it's not a normal time so

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,719
tonight I want to talk as plainly as i

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:15,440
can

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,880
about the stakes in this election

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,560
because what we do these next 76 days

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,480
will echo through generations to come

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,080
i'm in philadelphia where our

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,920
constitution was drafted and signed

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,280
it wasn't a perfect document it allowed

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,760
for

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,040
the inhumanity of slavery and failed to

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,239
guarantee women

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,280
and even men who didn't own property

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,800
the right to participate in the

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,440
political process

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,480
but embedded in this document was a

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,160
north star that would guide future

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,320
generations

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,199
a system of representative government a

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,960
democracy

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,199
through which we could better realize

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,640
our highest ideals

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,760
through civil war and bitter struggles

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,640
we improved this constitution to include

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,760
the voices of those

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,960
who'd once been left out and gradually

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,240
we made this country

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,600
more just and more equal

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,640
and more free

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,920
the one constitutional office elected by

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,439
all of the people

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,479
is the presidency so to minimum

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,640
we should expect a president to feel a

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,479
sense of responsibility

38
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,000
for the safety and welfare of all 330

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
million of us

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,680
regardless of what we look like how we

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,360
worship who we love

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,920
how much money we have or who we voted

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,079
for

44
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,079
but we should also expect a president to

45
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,439
be the custodian of this democracy

46
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,079
we should expect that regardless of ego

47
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,119
ambition

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,320
or political beliefs the president will

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,360
preserve

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,399
protect and defend the freedoms and

51
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,759
ideals that

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,959
so many americans marched for went to

53
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,959
jail for

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,120
fought for and died for

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,440
i have sat in the oval office with both

56
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,879
of the men who are running for president

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,120
i never expected that my successor would

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
embrace my vision

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,319
or continue my policies

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,519
i did hope for the sake of our country

61
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,239
that donald trump might show some

62
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:34,879
interest

63
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,160
in taking the job seriously

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,319
that he might come to feel the weight of

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,920
the office

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,480
and discover some reverence for the

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,640
democracy that had been placed in his

68
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,440
care

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,720
but he never did

70
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,360
for close to four years now he has shown

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,920
no

72
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,800
interest in putting in the work no

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,959
interest in finding common ground

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,840
no interest in using the awesome power

75
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,680
of his office to help anyone but

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,959
himself and his friends

77
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,120
no interest in treating the presidency

78
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
as anything but one more reality show

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,879
that he can use

80
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,440
to get the attention he craves

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,400
donald trump hasn't grown into the job

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,799
because he can't

83
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,959
and the consequences of that failure are

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,159
severe

85
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,640
170 000 americans dead

86
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,080
millions of jobs gone while those at the

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,519
top taken more than ever

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,560
our worst impulses unleashed

89
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,879
our proud reputation around the world

90
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,680
badly diminished

91
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,599
and our democratic institutions

92
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,280
threatened like never before

93
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,040
now I know that in times as polarized as

94
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,319
these

95
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,239
most of you have already made up your

96
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,400
mind

97
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,120
but maybe you're still not sure which

98
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,360
candidate you'll vote for

99
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,480
or whether you'll vote at all

100
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,080
maybe you're tired of the direction

101
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,920
we're headed but you can't

102
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,320
see a better path yet or you just don't

103
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,759
know enough about the person

104
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,199
who wants to lead us there

105
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,520
so let me tell you about my friend joe

106
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,600
biden

107
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,759
12 years ago when I began my search for

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,840
a vice president

109
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,520
i didn't know i'd end up finding a

110
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,240
brother

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,560
joe and I come from different places

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,880
different generations but

113
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,240
what I quickly came to admire about

114
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,280
joe biden is his resilience born of too

115
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,600
much

116
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,720
struggle his empathy

117
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
born of too much grief

118
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,360
joe is a man who learned early on to

119
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,840
treat

120
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,240
every person he meets with respect and

121
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,520
dignity

122
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,600
living by the words his parents taught

123
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,639
him no one's better than you joe

124
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,800
but you're better than nobody

125
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,800
that empathy that decency

126
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,080
the belief that everybody counts

127
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,360
that's who joe is

128
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,520
when he talks with someone who's lost

129
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,120
her job joe remembers the night his

130
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,800
father sat him down to say

131
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,240
that he'd lost his

132
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,160
when joe listens to a parent who's

133
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,440
trying to hold it

134
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,560
all together right now he does it

135
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,199
as a single dad who took the train back

136
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,680
to

137
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
wilmington each and every night so he

138
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,840
could tuck his kids into bed

139
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,479
when he meets with military families

140
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
who've lost their hero

141
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,600
he does it as a kindred spirit the

142
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,320
parent

143
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,360
of an american soldier somebody whose

144
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,800
faith has endured

145
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,440
the hardest loss there is

146
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,600
for eight years joe was the last one in

147
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,039
the room whenever

148
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,479
i faced a big decision he made me a

149
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,840
better president

150
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,520
and he's got the character and the

151
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,960
experience to make us

152
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,240
a better country and in my friend

153
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,400
kamala harris he's chosen an ideal

154
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,600
partner

155
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,039
who is more than prepared for the job

156
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,400
someone who knows what it's like to

157
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
overcome barriers and who's made a

158
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
career

159
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,080
fighting to help others live out their

160
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,160
own american dream

161
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,759
along with the experience needed to get

162
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,440
things done joe and kamala

163
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
have concrete policies that will turn

164
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,720
their vision of a better

165
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,039
fairer stronger country into reality

166
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,960
they will get this pandemic under

167
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,199
control like joe did when he helped me

168
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,759
manage

169
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,960
h1n1 and prevent an ebola outbreak from

170
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,759
reaching our shores

171
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,599
they'll expand healthcare to more

172
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,680
americans like joe and I did 10 years

173
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,720
ago

174
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,880
when he helped craft the affordable care

175
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,960
act and nail down the votes to make it

176
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,840
the law

177
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,080
they'll rescue the economy like joe

178
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,880
helped me do

179
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,599
after the great recession I asked him to

180
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,039
manage the recovery act

181
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,039
which jump started the longest stretch

182
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,039
of job growth in history

183
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,280
and he sees this moment now not as a

184
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,479
chance to get back to where we were

185
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,880
but to make long overdue changes so that

186
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,000
our economy actually

187
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
makes life a little easier for everybody

188
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
whether it's the waitress trying to

189
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,360
raise a kid on her own

190
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
or the shift worker always on the edge

191
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,199
of getting laid off

192
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,520
or the student figuring out how to pay

193
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,759
for next semester's classes

194
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,919
joe and kamala will restore our standing

195
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,759
in the world and as we've learned from

196
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,800
this pandemic

197
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,400
that matters joe knows the world

198
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,000
and the world knows him

199
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,560
he knows that our true strength comes

200
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,639
from setting an example

201
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,759
that the world wants to follow a nation

202
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,599
that stands with democracy

203
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,319
not dictators a nation that can inspire

204
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,800
and mobilize others to overcome threats

205
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,280
like climate change and terrorism

206
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,080
poverty and disease

207
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,599
but more than anything what I know

208
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,919
about joe what I know about kamala

209
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,719
is that they actually care about every

210
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,120
american

211
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,000
and that they care deeply about this

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,440
democracy

213
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,480
they believe that in a democracy

214
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,880
the right to vote is sacred and we

215
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,959
should be making it easier for people to

216
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,240
cast their ballots

217
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,519
not harder

218
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,160
they believe that no one including the

219
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,440
president

220
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,880
is above the law and that no public

221
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,680
official

222
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,480
including the president should use their

223
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,040
office

224
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,800
to enrich themselves or their supporters

225
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,120
they understand that in this democracy

226
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,959
the commander-in-chief

227
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,680
does not use the men and women of our

228
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,600
military who are willing to risk

229
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,800
everything to protect our nation as

230
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,760
political props

231
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
to deploy against peaceful protesters on

232
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,320
our own soil

233
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,000
they understand that political opponents

234
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
aren't un-american just because they

235
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,160
disagree

236
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,080
with you a free press isn't the enemy

237
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
but the way we hold officials

238
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,839
accountable

239
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,519
that our ability to work together to

240
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,240
solve big problems like a pandemic

241
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,959
depend on a fidelity to facts and

242
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:51,600
science

243
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,480
and logic and not just making stuff up

244
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,560
none of this should be controversial

245
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,440
these shouldn't be republican principles

246
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
or democratic principles they are

247
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,720
american principles

248
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,720
but at this moment this president

249
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,920
and those who enable them have shown

250
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,760
they don't believe in these things

251
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,279
tonight i'm asking you to believe in joe

252
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,959
and kamala's ability to lead this

253
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,200
country out of these dark times and

254
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,000
build it back better

255
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,440
here's the thing no single american

256
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,480
can fix this country alone not even a

257
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,800
president

258
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,560
democracy was never meant to be

259
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
transactional you give me your vote i

260
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,720
make everything better

261
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,040
it requires an active and informed

262
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,680
citizenry

263
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,240
so i'm also asking you to believe in

264
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,760
your own ability

265
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,839
to embrace your own responsibility as

266
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,440
citizens to make sure that the basic

267
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,079
tenets

268
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,360
of our democracy endure because that's

269
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,240
what's at stake right now

270
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,959
our democracy

271
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,399
look I understand why

272
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,680
a lot of americans are down on

273
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,560
government the way the rules have been

274
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,120
set up

275
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,320
and abused in congress make it easier

276
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,120
for special interests to stop progress

277
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,240
than to make progress

278
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,079
believe me I i know it I understand why

279
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:32,560
a

280
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,079
white factory worker who's seen his

281
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,800
wages cut or his job shipped overseas

282
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,839
might feel like

283
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,839
the government no longer looks out for

284
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,040
him

285
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,600
and why a black mom might feel like it

286
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,200
never looked out for her at all

287
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,360
i understand why a new immigrant might

288
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,040
look around this country and wonder

289
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,880
whether there's still a place for him

290
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,720
here

291
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,079
why a young person might look at

292
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,920
politics right now

293
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,320
the circus of it all the meanness and

294
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,760
the lies

295
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,200
and conspiracy theories and think

296
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,600
what is the point

297
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,680
well here's the point this president

298
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
and those in power those who benefit

299
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,880
from keeping things

300
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,920
the way they are they are counting on

301
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,279
your cynicism

302
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,360
they know they can't win you over with

303
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
their policies

304
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,279
so they're hoping to make it as hard as

305
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,480
possible

306
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,440
for you to vote and to convince you that

307
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,959
your vote does not matter

308
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,320
that is how they win that is how they

309
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,240
get to keep making decisions that affect

310
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,440
your life

311
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,120
and the lives of the people you love

312
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,880
that's how the economy will keep getting

313
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,320
skewed to the wealthy and well-connected

314
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
how our health systems will let more

315
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,720
people fall through the cracks

316
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,760
that's how a democracy withers

317
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,440
until it's no democracy at all

318
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,600
and we cannot let that happen

319
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,360
do not let them take away your power

320
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,680
do not let them take away your democracy

321
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,079
make a plan right now for how you are

322
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,399
going to get involved and vote

323
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,959
do it as early as you can and tell your

324
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,880
family and friends how they can vote too

325
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,360
do what americans have done for over two

326
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,440
centuries when faced

327
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,120
with even tougher times than this

328
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
all those quiet heroes who found the

329
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,279
courage to keep marshy

330
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,399
keep pushing in the face of hardship and

331
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,959
injustice

332
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,079
last month we lost a giant of american

333
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,360
democracy

334
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,480
in john lewis and some years ago I sat

335
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,199
down with john

336
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,639
and a few remaining leaders of

337
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,240
the early civil rights movement

338
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,480
one of them told me he never imagined

339
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,040
he'd walk into the white house

340
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,519
and see a president who looked like his

341
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,920
grandson

342
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,079
and then he told me that he had looked

343
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,279
it up

344
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,279
and it turned out that on the very day

345
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,760
that I was born

346
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,519
he was marching into a jail cell

347
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,360
trying to end jim crow segregation in

348
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,279
the south

349
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,480
what we do echoes

350
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,000
through generations

351
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,399
whatever our backgrounds we are all the

352
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,160
children of americans who fought the

353
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
good fight

354
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,800
great grandparents working in fire traps

355
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
and sweatshops without rights

356
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,920
or representation farmers

357
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,279
losing their dreams to dust

358
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,680
irish and italians and asians and

359
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,800
latinos told

360
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,800
go back where you come from

361
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
jews and catholics muslims and sikhs

362
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,600
made to feel suspect for the way they

363
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,199
worshipped

364
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,040
black americans chained and whipped

365
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,959
and hanged spit on

366
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,560
for trying to sit at lunch counters

367
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,639
beaten for trying to vote

368
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,079
if anyone had a right to believe that

369
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,639
this democracy did not work

370
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,759
and could not work it was those

371
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,959
americans

372
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,000
our ancestors they were on

373
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
the receiving end of a democracy that

374
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,399
had fallen short all their lives

375
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,440
they knew how far the daily reality of

376
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,279
america strayed from the mid

377
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,720
and yet instead of giving up they joined

378
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,839
together

379
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,120
and they said somehow some way we are

380
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,480
going to make this work

381
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,759
we are going to bring those words

382
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:16,240
in our founding documents to life

383
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,320
i have seen that same spirit rising

384
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,199
these past few years

385
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,360
folks of every age and background who

386
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,800
packed city centers and

387
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,759
airports and rural roads so that

388
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,399
families wouldn't be separated

389
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,240
so that another classroom wouldn't get

390
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,399
shot up

391
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,639
so that our kids won't grow up on an

392
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,959
uninhabitable planet

393
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,360
americans of all races joining together

394
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,199
to declare

395
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,320
in the face of injustice

396
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,160
and brutality at the hands of the state

397
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,920
that black lives matter no more

398
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,440
but no less so that no child in this

399
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,000
country

400
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,480
feels the continuing sting of racism

401
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,799
to the young people who led us this

402
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,240
summer telling us

403
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,280
we need to be better

404
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,240
in so many ways you are this country's

405
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,079
dreams fulfilled

406
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,559
earlier generations had to be persuaded

407
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,919
that everyone

408
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,520
has equal worth for you it's a given

409
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,559
a conviction

410
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,160
and what I want you to know is that for

411
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,559
all its messiness and frustrations

412
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,200
your system of self-government

413
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,720
can be harnessed to help you realize

414
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,480
those convictions for all of us

415
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,520
you can give our democracy new meaning

416
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,640
you can take it to a better place

417
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,840
you're the missing ingredient the ones

418
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,360
who will decide whether or not

419
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,320
america becomes the country that fully

420
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,200
lives up

421
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,520
to its creed

422
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,440
that work will continue long after this

423
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,679
election

424
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,480
but any chance of success depends

425
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,840
entirely

426
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,480
on the outcome of this election

427
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,240
this administration has shown it will

428
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,760
tear our democracy

429
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,640
down if that's what it takes for them to

430
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,320
win

431
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,600
so we have to get busy building it up

432
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,880
by pouring all our efforts into these 76

433
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,080
days

434
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,280
and by voting like never before for joe

435
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,480
and kamala

436
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,600
and candidates up and down the ticket

437
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,120
so that we leave no doubt about

438
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,320
what this country that we love

439
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,919
stands for today

440
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,720
and for all our days to come

441
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,000
stay safe god bless
