`201120` Walk-AARCH: Meeting notes

# AARCH Winter 2021, Graduation website.



## Notes on Sketches

Circles could contain a GIF
Circles should be "more architectual", as in "more spatial"
Circles could morph betwen pre-defined - or user-drawn(! Klaus) "targets"
as in: Draw a shape in the sidebar, and have the Circles mimic it -> "processing architecture"



## Tasks for W48/Sketches:

- Draw shapetargets (Jørgen)
- Research Services (Jørgen)
- Update subtitle player to use the VIMEO player
- Send SRT to Karen/Lea
- Next meeting: Thursday 09.00
